Spotify Music Recommendation System

Music streaming services are the most used platform for listening to music. Streaming services such as Spotify, Amazon and Apple Music offer their customers millions of songs to discover. Users pay a monthly subscription where they have unlimited access to the services catalogue. They come as web based and as desktop applications. These platforms bring features such as liking songs, creating endless playlists, sharing music, and the list the goes on. The user however does not own any of the music, whereas if you had CDs, you were able to rip them into mp3 files for your own personal use. With each streaming service, they have their own recommendation systems providing the users with a more personalized music recommendation.
Music streaming services ultimately want to make money and if their music recommendation system is seen by users as a key feature of membership then users will want to stay loyal to the platform.  As a result, the major services have all developed recommendation systems that analyse usersâ€™ playlists and make recommendations. Most music recommendation systems in these streaming services use collaborative and content-based filtering techniques.
